# README Etienne's Branch

Currently, the python scripts just produce a random path for the P22 problem.

## Format to use for the JSON file
An example of the JSON file that can be read and played in Unity is shown by "traj.JSON". 
It basically keeps every variable already present in the orignal problem file, and append 
a "trajectories" field which is a list of all the successeive positions occupied by the different
agents.
You can however differ a bit from this format to add other informations to the trajectory.
